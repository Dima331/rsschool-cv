1. Hello, my name is Dmitry. My goal is to become a professional front-end developer who would work at interesting and unusual projects.
I have some experience working collectively on a project. I like when several professionals in their fields work together, discussing all the nuances together. I also want to be a professional and be responsible for my part of the work. I want to create unique things, make interesting layouts. And I like to make layouts until they become perfect. I like to see how websites are made, how people make layouts, what ways they do it. I have finished several online courses, at the same time I have experience in self-education. And I realized: to be good, you have to force yourself to work.
If you are interested in cooperating with me, you can easily find me on the links below or write me an e-mail, send the contact form.
1. My skills: html/pug, bem, css/sass,postcss,  php, mysql, js, webpack/gulp, vuejs, git, jquery.
